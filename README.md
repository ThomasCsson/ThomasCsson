My name is Thomas Christiansson and I am currently a masters student at EPFL (Swiss Federal Technology Institute of Lausanne) in Chemical Engineering. 

I completed by bachelors in Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at EPFL in 2025 after having spent a year in Norway at NTNU (the Norwegian Univeristy of Science and Technology) on an academic exchange where I got the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of chemical engineering and particularly computational chemical engineering in MatLab, Julia and Python.


## Projects I have worked on/am currently working on ðŸ”¥:

-MASSIVEChem: A collaborative Python package focused on mass spectrometry, developped during my second year at EPFL, that simulates the mass spectrum of any given molecule.

-Langmuir.jl: This package implements single adsorption and multicomponent adsorption through Ideal Absorbed Solution Theory (IAST). I had the pleasure of working on this with researchers from NTNU.
