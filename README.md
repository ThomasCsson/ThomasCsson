I am Thomas Christiansson, and I am currently a bachelors student at EPFL (Swiss Federal Technology Institute of Lausanne) in Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. This year, for the final year of my degree, I am on an exchange at NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology), specialising in Chemical Engineering.

## Projects I have worked on/am currently working on ðŸ”¥:

-MASSIVEChem: A collaborative Python package focused on mass spectrometry, developped during my second year at EPFL, that simulates the mass spectrum of any given molecule. 

-Langmuir.jl: This package implements single adsorption and multicomponent adsorption through Ideal Absorbed Solution Theory (IAST). I am corrently working on this with researchers from NTNU.

You can contact me via either of my emails: thomas.christiansson@epfl.ch or thomasvc@stud.ntnu.no
